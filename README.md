# Matebook-X-Pro-Hackintosh-latest-update.
Use on par with my guide. Note: Since I've been busy with school lately, r/gnodipacc886 has really taken over this project. The EFI folder here is from the work of him. So if you liked this guide and want to help me, consider donating to him first for all the hard work that he's done. :)

## Also, if you really want to, you can help me out with a small donation..Thanks!
